    <h1>Explain the role of the following key properties in the flexbox layout model </h1>
    <h2>1. Justify-content</h2>
    <h3>stretch</h3>
    <p>1.This value causes the flex items to stretch to fill the entire height of the flex container along the cross-axis.</p>
    <p>2.If no fixed height is specified for the items, they will be stretched to match the height of the tallest item.</p>

    <h3>flex-start</h3>
    <p>1.This value aligns the flex items at the start of the cross-axis.</p>
    <p>2.The items will be aligned to the beginning of the flex container along the cross-axis.</p>

    <h3>flex-end</h3>
    <p>1.This value aligns the flex items at the end of the cross-axis.</p>
    <p>2.The items will be aligned to the end of the flex container along the cross-axis.
    </p>

    <h3>center</h5>
    <p>1.This value centers the flex items along the cross-axis.</p>
    <p>1.The items will be vertically centered within the flex container.</p>

   <h3>baseline</h3>
   <p>1.This value aligns the flex items such that their baselines are aligned.</p>
   <p>2.The baseline is an imaginary line that defines the position of the text baseline within each item. Items will be aligned based on their text baselines.</p>

    <h1>2.gap</h1>
    <p>1.The gap property in Flexbox is used to control the spacing between flex items along the main axis and the cross-axis.</p>
    
    <p>2.It allows you to specify the gap between adjacent flex items in a flex container, making it easier to manage the spacing between items without having to rely solely on margins or padding.</p>

    <p>3.The gap property is shorthand for setting both row-gap (vertical gap) and column-gap (horizontal gap) between flex items.</p>

    <p>4.It's especially useful when you have a grid-like layout within a Flexbox container, and you want to control the spacing between the rows and columns of flex items.</p>

    <h1>3.Flex-direction</h1>
    <p><strong>row:</strong> This is the default value. It arranges flex items horizontally along the main axis, which is typically left to right in languages that use a horizontal writing mode (like English).</p>

    <p><strong>row-reverse:</strong> This is similar to <strong>'row'</strong> but it reverses the order of flex items along the main axis. So, the last item will appear first, and the first item will appear last.</p>

    <p><strong>column:</strong>This value arranges flex items vertically along the main axis, from top to bottom. This is useful for creating vertically oriented layouts.</p>

    <p><strong>column-reverse:</strong>   Like <strong>'cloumn'</strong> it arranges flex items vertically along the main axis, but in reverse order, with the last item appearing at the top and the first item at the bottom.</p>

    <h1>4.flex-wrap</h1>
    <p><strong>nowrap:</strong>(default) This value ensures that all flex items stay on a single line and do not wrap to the next line, even if there is not enough space available along the main axis. This means that flex items may overflow their container if they can't fit within the available space.</p>

    <p><strong>wrap:</strong> When set to <strong>wrap</strong>, flex items will wrap onto the next line if they can't fit within the available space along the main axis. This behavior allows flex items to flow onto multiple lines if necessary.</p>

    <p><strong>wrap-reverse:</strong>This value is similar to <strong>wrap</strong>, but it wraps flex items in the reverse order. Items that would normally appear at the end of the line will wrap to the beginning of the next line.</p>
